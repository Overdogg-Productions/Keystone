Changelog

	November 25, 2016
	═════════════════════════════════════════
	- Added Smart Camera System
	- Player now stops increasing in altitude upon colliding with a ceiling. Because the jump height is relative to an initial force + the time spent holding the jump key, the player could continue to hold jump after colliding with a ceiling and maintain that momentum of their jump after sliding out from beneath a ceiling or platform.
	- Character jump height and speed slightly adjusted.
